Description: DataCalendar is a Windows Desktop Application, made to be a Calendar based platform for data input.

The central idea behind DataCalendar is that of creating a Calendar application that is viable for raw data storage in a simple, non-bloated, efficient manner.

It has low preformance and memory requirements as well as compatability with older windows versions.

For whom is this program? Anyone who loves to put data into his calendar. The calendar provides for this also, rtf compatibility, which enables you edit your text font using rtf.

The main difference between this calendar and all other calendars is that it isnt notification based, but is more concerned with storing, organizing, sorting and presentation of data.

Features:
- Change colors of any windows in the calendar
- Simple saving mechanism, marksdata, last selected data , data itself, by only copy pasting files.
- Easy to read raw data, the format of documents that are self created by the program, are easy to read, access and understand.
- Scripting mechanism, input data coupled with macros into multiple dates by using the apps own scripting mechanism!
- Use any year range that you desire.
- Simple and intuitive UI design
- Standalone.
